This is a version of the Protege plugin tutorial found at http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/PluginAnatomy .
The build file had to be altered so that jar names match the distribution of Protege I was using.

Prerequisites for building:
    - Ant installed (if on Windows, this includes manually setting the ANT_HOME env variable
    and appending it to the PATH variable)

Build instructions:
    - Set an environment variable called PROTEGE_HOME to point at the filepath of your Protege distribution.
    - To generate a jar to copy to Protege's plugins folder, run 'ant jar'
    - To install directly to Protege's plugin folder without the need to drop the jar manually,
    run 'ant install'
    - The -v option can be very handy.
