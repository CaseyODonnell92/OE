This is a natural language description of everything we need to capture in our ontology (everything is based on the information at http://Pokemon.wikia.com regarding Gen I)

Every Pokemon has a type
Some Pokemon have two types
There are 18 types (Not listed here)
All Pokemon have hitpoints/health
All Pokemon can perform moves
There are three kinds of move: Physical, Special and Status
Only Phyiscal and Special moves do damage (i.e reduce health/hitpoints)
All moves have a type (which correspond to the 18 types)
There is an interaction between move type and Pokemon type that determines whether a move is "super-effective", "not very effective" or "has no effect" when used against a Pokemon
